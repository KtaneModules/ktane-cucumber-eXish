                <h2>On the Subject of Cucumber</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">“Cucumber!” - Kavin</p>
                <p>On the module is a cucumber. You must eat the cucumber.</p>
                <p>To take a bite out of the cucumber simply press it. After 5 bites you will have full ingested the cucumber, and the module will solve.</p>
                <p>However you cannot take bites out of the cucumber too quickly, otherwise the sheer amount of cucumber you are taking in will choke you and give you a strike. Wait at least 30 seconds (bomb time) between each bite for your own safety.</p>
                <p><b>If the bomb’s starting time is less than 2 minutes, then you are taking part in a cucumber eating contest and need to stuff the cucumber directly down your throat. To do this simply press the cucumber as if you were going to take a bite.</b></p>
